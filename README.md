This project was bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started), an 
opinionated toolkit for creating react applications that's bundled with features including a local development server, 
testing framework, preconfigured webpack and buildscripts and more. To keep things simple, the testing framework has 
been removed.

### Available Scripts
In this **project root directory**, you can run:

#### `npm install`
This is a npm command that installs all dependencies for this project that are listed in package.json.

#### `npm start`
This command has been added and configured for us by Create React App and will launch our app in development mode.

#### `npm run build`
This command has also been provided to us by Create React App and will compile all .jsx into regular javascript 
and create a folder `build` with the files needed to run this app in a web browser.
___
### Local dev environment
- Go ahead and run `npm install` and then `npm start`.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view this React app in the browser.
  The page will reload if you make edits, and you will also see any errors in the console.

There is just going to be a blank white screen at the moment. Keep this window open as we make edits in the following 
steps.

###  Project layout
Here is what the current directory layout looks like:
* [/public â§‰](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/using-the-public-folder/)
  * acm_logo.png
  * favicon.ico
  * index.html
* /src
  * App.js
  * /features
    * Body.jsx
    * Footer.jsx
    * Header.jsx
    * Layout.jsx
    * /theme
      * theme.js
  * index.js
  
- `/public` contains HTML and can also hold images and files
- `/public/index.html` the page template.
- `/src` where we will keep all of our source code.
- `/src/app.js` a component that acts as a container for all other components.
- `/src/features` directory to keep all our UI features
- `/src/features/Layout.jsx` a container component wrapping our Header, Footer and Body components.
- `/src/features/theme/theme.js` outlines the color scheme used in the MUI component library.
- `/src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point and contains the logic for rendering the **App** component.

### App.js
[Material UI](https://mui.com) (MUI) is a React component library styled using the
[Material Design UI framework](https://material.io/design/introduction). 
MUI is configured in `App.js` by wrapping all
other components within `<ThemeProvider />`. We are going to use a custom theme by importing and passing 
**lightTheme** to **ThemeProvider** within a **theme** prop.

Replace App.js with the following:
```jsx
// App.js
import Layout from "./features/Layout";
import {ThemeProvider} from "@mui/material/styles";
import CssBaseline from "@mui/material/CssBaseline";
import lightTheme from "./features/theme/theme";

function App() {
    return (
            <ThemeProvider theme={lightTheme}>
                <CssBaseline />
                <Layout />
            </ThemeProvider>
    );
}

export default App;
```
- `<CssBaseline />`
is a component provided by MUI that normalizes css styling across devices and browsers. 
[https://mui.com/material-ui/react-css-baseline/](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-css-baseline/)
- `<Layout />` is a component created for this app to structure the page layout.
___
### Theme.js
Take a look at `/src/features/theme/theme.js`. When we added `lightTheme` earlier to `<ThemeProvider/>`, it was 
exported from `theme.js`. **lightTheme*** is a custom theme defined by using MUI's `createTheme()`.
```jsx
// theme.js
import {createTheme, responsiveFontSizes} from "@mui/material";

export const lightTheme = responsiveFontSizes(
        createTheme({
...
```
- `createTheme` 
[https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/theming/](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/theming/)
- `responsiveFontSizes` makes it so that our theme will scale font sizes based on browser dimensions. \

### Layout.jsx
We will cover MUI more in [part&nbsp;4](https://github.com/rosealexander/react-mui-workshop/tree/part4-MUI)
but for now, lets replace Layout.jsx with the following and see what it does. 
```jsx
// Layout.jsx
import Header from './Header';
import Body from './Body'
import Footer from "./Footer";
import {Box, Container} from "@mui/material";

const Layout = () => {
    return (
        <Container
            maxWidth='xs'
        >
            <Box
                display='flex'
                flexDirection='column'
                justifyContent='space-between'
                height='100vh'
                py={2}
            >
                <Header/>
                <Body />
                <Footer/>
            </Box>
        </Container>
    )
}
export default Layout
```
Now we can finally see something in our local dev environment.
- `<Container />` is a core MUI component type that we can wrap around other components, in this case we are wrapping it 
around everything inside the **Layout** component. Passing **xs** into the **maxWidth** prop restricts the component 
width within the **xs** breakpoint defined in our custom theme.
```js
// theme.js
export const lightTheme = responsiveFontSizes(
...
breakpoints: {
    values: {
        xs: 0,
        sm: 600,
        md: 900,
        lg: 1200,
        xl: 1536,
    },
},
```
- The `Header` and `Footer` components have already been defined for us so don't worry about these too much right now 
and `Body` is just serving as a placeholder that we will revisit. 

You should be seeing this at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):
