and check out the [Getting Started](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) page for a quick overview.

### Material UI
MUI is a simple and customizable component library to build faster, beautiful, and more accessible React applications.
MUI components follow the [Material Design](https://material.io/design/introduction) system.
