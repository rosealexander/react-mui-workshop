`/public/index.html`  is the page template\
`/app.js` is a component that acts as a container for all other components.\
`/src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point\
`/src/features/Layout.jsx` a container component wrapping our Header Footer and Body components.\
`/src/features/theme/theme.js` outlines the color scheme used in the MUI component library.

### MUI configuration
[Material UI](https://mui.com) (MUI) is a React component library styled using the
[Material Design UI framework](https://material.io/design/introduction). MUI is configured in `App.js` by wrapping all
other components within the ThemeProvider component. We can customize the MUI color scheme using the createTheme 
function and passing our customized theme into ThemeProvider using the **theme** prop.
