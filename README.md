### Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started), an opinionated 
toolkit for creating react applications that's bundled with features including a local development server, 
testing framework, preconfigured webpack and buildscripts and much more. To keep things simple, the testing framework 
has been removed.

### Available Scripts
In the project root directory, you can run:

#### `npm install`
This is a npm command that installs all dependencies for this project that are listed in package.json.

#### `npm start`
This command has been added and configured for us by Create React App and will launch our app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
#### `npm run build`
This command has also been provided to us by Create React App and will compile all of our .jsx into regular javascript 
and create a folder `build` that has all the files needed to run in a web browser.

###  Project layout
* [/public â§‰](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/using-the-public-folder/)

- `/public/index.html`  is the page template\
- `/app.js` is a component that acts as a container for all other components.\
- `/src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point\
- `/src/features/Layout.jsx` a container component wrapping our Header Footer and Body components.\
- `/src/features/theme/theme.js` outlines the color scheme used in the MUI component library.

### App.js
[Material UI](https://mui.com) (MUI) is a React component library styled using the
[Material Design UI framework](https://material.io/design/introduction). MUI is configured in `App.js` by wrapping all
other components within the ThemeProvider component. We can customize the MUI color scheme using the createTheme 
function and passing our customized theme into ThemeProvider using the **theme** prop.
```jsx
// App.js
import Layout from "./features/Layout";
import {ThemeProvider} from "@mui/material/styles";
import CssBaseline from "@mui/material/CssBaseline";
import lightTheme from "./features/theme/theme";

function App() {
    return (
            <ThemeProvider theme={lightTheme}>
                <CssBaseline />
                <Layout />
            </ThemeProvider>
    );
}

export default App;
```
___
### Theme.js
```jsx
// theme.js
import {createTheme, responsiveFontSizes} from "@mui/material";

export const lightTheme = responsiveFontSizes(
        createTheme({
...
```
___
```jsx
// layout.jsx
import Header from './Header';
import Body from './Body'
import Footer from "./Footer";
import {Box, Container} from "@mui/material";

const Layout = () => {
    return (
        <Container
            maxWidth='xs'
        >
            <Box
                display='flex'
                flexDirection='column'
                justifyContent='space-between'
                height='100vh'
                py={2}
            >
                <Header/>
                <Body />
                <Footer/>
            </Box>
        </Container>
    )
}

export default Layout
```
